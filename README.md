# TxMM-Election-Prediction

This repository is accompanying the paper "'What If the News Voted?' - Predicting Elections by News Coverage" written for the course "Text and Multi-Media Mining". 

Abstract: 
Political news headlines serve as concise sources of information on crucial political matters and wield the potential to influence voting decisions. This study endeavors to predict election outcomes based on an analysis of political news headlines, employing targeted sentiment analysis to assess the sentiments associated with various topics and political parties, and comparing them to corresponding party programs. However, the predictive accuracy of this approach was found to be lacking in the context of the Bavarian Election held in 2023, as it failed to accurately forecast the actual voting results
